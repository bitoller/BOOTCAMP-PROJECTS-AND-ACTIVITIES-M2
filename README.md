# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `second module`, or `M2` for short.<br />
[M1](https://github.com/bitoller/BOOTCAMP-PROJECTS-AND-ACTIVITIES-M1) | [M2](https://github.com/bitoller/BOOTCAMP-PROJECTS-AND-ACTIVITIES-M2)

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M2` means `Module 2`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.
